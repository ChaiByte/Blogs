"Why do certain individuals take pleasure in producing loud chewing sounds while dining?"

Some individuals, who cannot tolerate such sounds, may perceive this as a breach of etiquette. 
Within our society, there exists a segment of people who exhibit notably adverse reactions to particular sounds. 
Because such occurrences are relatively infrequent, they tend to dismiss them, enduring the discomfort until it passes. 
However, often they are unaware that they may have Misophonia.

Misophonia refers to the phenomenon where certain sounds elicit strong emotional responses, typically characterized by anger, 
though it can also manifest as irritation, rage, anxiety, or disgust. 
Common triggers include repetitive noises such as chewing, breathing, lip smacking, or tapping. 
Misophonia frequently coexists with other conditions, 
including anxiety, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and sensory processing disorder. 
It also tends to be more prevalent among individuals with tinnitus and hyperacusis.

As a member of the Misophonia community, 
I possess an unusual sensitivity to specific sounds originating from the human mouth, including burping and lip-smacking. 
During my youth, I would vehemently voice my frustration to my mother, exclaiming, "Why do you eat so loudly, resembling a pig?" 
Over time, I began to understand that there was more to this heightened sensitivity than I initially thought.
Whenever I encountered individuals speaking with particular accents, especially those from northern regions, 
I would endure physical discomfort and an involuntary sense of nausea. 
Initially, I attributed this reaction to a bias against individuals who weren't fluent in Mandarin. 
Yet, upon closer introspection, I came to the realization that this reaction did not extend to other dialects.

At its worst, I couldn't bear the sound of hushed conversations from neighboring teams in the office. 
It wasn't that I wanted to be nosy; it was a purely physiological response, much like auditory hypersensitivity. 
These negative feelings further affected my emotions and well-being. 
Fortunately, we always have the choice, even though it took me a long time after resigning to realize that 
his might have been one of the contributing factors to my deteriorating emotional state during that period.

Returning to the initial topic, if I were to educate my future children about not making loud chewing noises while eating, 
I wouldn't frame it as a matter of manners. 
Instead, I would teach them to consider the feelings of vulnerable groups, 
much like we wouldn't expect someone with alcohol intolerance to drink. 
Each one of us, to a greater or lesser extent, has something we fear; 
some fear heights, some fear water. If certain individuals fear specific sounds, 
it's perfectly reasonable for them to proactively communicate with potential sources of those sounds, negotiate for solutions, 
rather than silently endure it on their own. 
Only when more people regard this fear of sounds as an adverse symptom can we foster mutual understanding among individuals.

Note: The annoying sound of smacking lips that some people dislike actually comes from the habit of chewing with an open mouth. 
In reality, simply chewing with your mouth closed can prevent conflicts between both parties, 
and this only requires very few practice sessions to change.
