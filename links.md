Some websites may contain sensitive political statements. 
Quoting them here does not imply that I share the same political views.
I respect everyone's right to speak, that is, freedom of speech.

Websites added to my [ublacklist](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/) filter for search engine:

- [CSDN](https://www.csdn.net/) (If you want to be a better programmer, GIYF, RTFM)
- [Tencent Cloud Developer Community](https://cloud.tencent.com/developer) / [Aliyun Developer Community](https://developer.aliyun.com) / ...
- Self-publishing platforms on the Chinese internet can be quite chaotic.

Although the above platforms may have the potential to produce high-quality articles, 
I'm not willing to spend my energy panning for gold in a pile of manure.
Everyone's initial attempts at writing are usually terrible, but if you've never seen what's considered a good piece, 
chances are you won't be able to produce anything of high quality either.
Birds of a feather flock together.
